Project Statement: Employee Management System with Spring Boot
Project Overview:

You are tasked with developing an Employee Management System (EMS) using Spring Boot. The application will handle CRUD
 operations for employee data, authenticate users using OAuth2, and implement various security measures. It will also
 be configured for different environments (development, production, and testing). The application will be deployed u
 sing Bamboo, and version control will be managed with Git.

Requirements:

Authentication and Authorization:

Implement OAuth2 authentication.
Configure roles for Admin and User.
Ensure secure access to APIs based on roles.
Use JWT tokens for securing APIs.
Environment Profiles:

Create profiles for dev, prod, and test.
Configure different data sources and properties for each profile.
CRUD Operations:

Implement CRUD operations for employee data.
Use Spring Data JPA for database interactions.
Database:

Use an SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).
Configure entities and repositories for JPA.
Security Features:

Implement OAuth2 and JWT authentication.
Role-based access control (RBAC) for Admin and User.
Secure sensitive data using encryption.
User Interface:

Create a web interface for managing employee data.
Use dropdowns to query results (e.g., by department, role).
Provide an admin dashboard for managing users and roles.
Configuration:

Externalize configuration using application properties.
Use YAML or properties files for different environments.
Configure Bamboo for CI/CD pipeline.
Integrate with Git for version control.
Deployment:

Deploy the application using Bamboo.
Configure Bamboo plans for building, testing, and deploying the application.
Advanced Features:

Implement search functionality with dropdown filters.
Provide logging and monitoring using Spring Boot Actuator.
Implement custom exception handling and error responses.
Step-by-Step Implementation:
