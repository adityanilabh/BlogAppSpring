# JpaSpringBoot Repository
Simple springboot project that integrates: 
1. all the crud api calls( like @PostMapping, @GetMapping, @DeleteMapping).
2. includes ResponseEntity(for hold over the payload send as response).
3. includes profile for dev,test and prod( only to show how we develop for different environment).
